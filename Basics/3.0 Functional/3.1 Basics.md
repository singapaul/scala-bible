# What's a function really? 

 All Scala objects are objects.


```
   val superAdder: Function1[Int, Function1[Int, Int]] = new Function1[Int, Function1[Int, Int]] {
    override def apply(x: Int): Function1[Int, Int] = new Function1[Int, Int] {
      override def apply(y: Int): Int = x + y
    }
  }

  val adder3 = superAdder(4)
  println(adder3(2))
  println(superAdder(2)(5)) // curried function
```

  We want to work with functions where we
   - pass functions as parameters
   - use functions as values

Problem - scala works on top of the JVM
   - designed for scala
   - first class eleements: objects(instances of classes)

Solution to this is that all scala objects are objects
   - function traits can take up to 22 parameters
   - syntactic sugar function types.


# Anonymous Functions 

Anonymous functions are also reffered to as LAMBDA functions 

Below are examples of anonymous functions

```
  val doubler: Int => Int = x => x*2
  val alsoDoubler = (x: Int) => x*2
```
  Handling multiple parameters and no parameters

```
    val adder: (Int, Int) => Int = (a: Int, b: Int) => a+b
    val justDoSomething: () => Int = () => 3
```

  println(justDoSomething) // results in pointer reference location and prints the function itself
  println(justDoSomething()) // calling the actual function


When using curly braces we follow the syntax below:

``` 
   val stringToInt = {(str: String)=>
    str.toInt
  }
```

We can use **syntactic sugar** to simplify expressions

```
  val niceIncrementer: Int => Int = _ + 1 /// equivalent to x=> x+1
  val niceAdder: (Int, Int) => Int = _ + _ // each underscore stands for diff parameter equivalent to (a.b) => a+b
```

## Anonymous summmary 

  Instead of passing anonymoys functionsX instances every time, which is OOP and cumbersome, we can pass
  lambda functions instead

  each paameter has a name and a type rules
  - parentheses are mandatory for more than one parameter
  - type is optional in LHS as return tpye is always inffered by RHS
