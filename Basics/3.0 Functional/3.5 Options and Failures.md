# Options and Failures

An option is a wrapper for a value that might be present or not
Some wraps a concrete value
None is a singleton for absent values
Options are present in many places inside Scala.
Instead of calling apply, we call the get operation. Which will return Some(value) or none
Options are popular in Scala because we want to avoid the null pointer exception like the plague.
Invented to work with un-safe APIs.

```
  val myOption: Option[Int] = Some(4)
  val noOption: Option[Int] = None

  functions on Options
  println(myOption.isEmpty)
  println(myOption.get) //UNSAFE DONT USE!

  map, flatMap, filter -> extremely useful!

  println(myOption.map(_*2))
  println(myOption.filter(x => x <10))
  println(myOption.flatMap(x => Option(x *10)))

```

We can wrap an unsafe API response with the below

```
  def unsafeMethod(): String = null
  val result = Option(unsafeMethod()) // will return Some or None
  println(result)
```

We can write chain methods, however they are not that human readable.

```
  def backupMethod(): String = "A valid result"
  val chainedResult = Option(unsafeMethod()).orElse(Option(backupMethod()))
  println(chainedResult)

```

We should instead wrtie our APIs so that they factor in potenial errors. e,g,

```
  def unsafeV2(): Option[String] = None
  def betterv2(): Option[String] = Some("A valdi result")
```


### Failures

We can wrap our results in success or failure messages.

```
  val aSuccess = Success(3)
  val aFailure = Failure(new RuntimeException("Failure"))

  println(aSuccess)
  println(aFailure)
```

```
def unsafeMethod(): String = throw new RuntimeException("NO STRING FOR YOU")

  val potenialFail = Try(unsafeMethod())
  println(potenialFail)

  //syntax sugar

  val anotherPotenialFailure = Try {
    //code that might throw exception
  val klfj  =2
  }


  //utilities
  println(potenialFail.isSuccess) //returns boolean

  //orElse

  def backupMethod(): String = "A validResult"
  val fallbackTry = Try(unsafeMethod()). orElse(Try(backupMethod()))
```

If you design the API // cleaner way to write the try catch

```
  def betterUnsafeMethod(): Try[String] = Failure(new RuntimeException())
  def betterBackupMethod(): Try[String] = Success("A valid result")
  val betterFallBack = betterUnsafeMethod() orElse betterBackupMethod()
```
