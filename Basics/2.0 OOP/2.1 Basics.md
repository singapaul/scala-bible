# Basics

We use classes just like in Java

a class organises data which is a representation of something

```
 class Person(name: String, val age: Int) {
    body
    val x = 2 //// we can use this value as it's a field of the object, even after vals are defined after it.
    var y = 3
    we can do anything in this block we'd do in a block expression

    We can add the below methods to the class as well.

    **Below is an example of method overloading**
    def greet(name: String): Unit = println(s"${this.name} says: Hello $name")
    def greet(): Unit = println(s"Hi I am $name")

    The class comes with its own constructor. But we can add more.
    See below with one constructor argument and one with none.
    Below is an example of an **auxillary constructor**
    def this(name: String) = this(name, 0)
    def this() =    this("John Doe")



```

## Parameters vs fields

age is a class parameter but not a field, cannot access by dot notation in order to get access to the age we need to add the keyword val in the class.

To remedy this we need to add val which will turn the parameter -> field

In the above example we used this.name to access the name instance on this instance.

** Instantiating a class **

```
  val person = new Person("John", 2)
  println(person.age)
```

### Further class examples

```
class Writer(firstName: String, surname: String,val year: Int){
  def fullName(): Unit = println(this.firstName + " " + this.surname)
}

class Novel(name: String, year: Int, author: Writer){

  def authorAge(): Unit = println(year - author.year)
  def isWrittenby(author: Writer) = author ==this.author
  def copy(newYear: Int): Novel = new Novel(name, newYear, author)


}


class Counter(val count: Int){
  def inc = new Counter(count + 1)  //immutable
  def dec = new Counter(count -1)

//recursive
  def inc(n: Int): Counter = {
  if (n<=0) this
  else inc.inc(n-1)
  }

```
