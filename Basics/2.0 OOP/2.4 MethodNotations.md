# Method notations

Below is an example of a class with several methods attached. Below we will examine a number of syntactic sugars we can use when implementing them.

```
class Person(val name: String, favouriteMovie: String, val age: Int = 0 ){

    def likes(movie: String): Boolean = movie ==favouriteMovie
    def hangOutWith(person: Person): String = s"${this.name} is hanging out with ${person.name}"
    def +(person: Person): String = s"${this.name} is hanging out with ${person.name}"
    def +(nickname: String): Person = new Person(s"$name $nickname", favouriteMovie, age)
    def unary_! : String = s"$name what the heck?"
    def unary_+ : Person = new Person(name, favouriteMovie, age + 1)
    def isAlive: Boolean = true
    def apply(): String = s"Hi my name is $name and I love $favouriteMovie"
    def apply(n: Int): String = s"${this.name} watched ${this.favouriteMovie} $n times"
    def learns(topic: String): String = s"$name learns $topic"
  }
```

### infix notation

When we only have one argument we can write arguments like this. Which are much more readble.

```
val mary = new Person("Mary", "Inception", 21)
  println(mary.likes("Inception"))
  println(mary likes "Inception")


  below are further examples

  val Tom = new Person("Tom", "Fight CLub", 16)
  println(mary hangOutWith Tom)
  println(mary + Tom)
```

keep in mind that in Scala, all operators are methods.

## Prefix notation

The unary prefix only works with - + ~ !

```
  val x = -1 // equivalent with 1.unary_-
  val y = 1.unary_-
```

## Postfix notation

This is only useful with methods that have no parameters, such as the below example

```
  println(mary.isAlive)
```

## Apply method

The below statements are equivalent due to the apply keyword argument

```
  println(mary.apply())
  println(mary())
```
