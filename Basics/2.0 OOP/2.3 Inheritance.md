# Inheritance (and traits)

Scala offers single class inheriteance/
We can make methods private in a class so they will not be extended
Access modifiers, private, protected
protected allows the use of the method eat within the sub class

## over riding

```
  class Animal {
    val creatureType = "Wild"
    protected def eat = println("nnomomnomnom")
  }

  class Cat extends Animal
  val cat = new Cat
```

super.eat will refer to the method in the super (parent) class.
The below code will over write the parent.

```
  class Dog(override val creatureType: String) extends Animal {
    override def eat = {
      super.eat
      println("crunch, munch")}
  }

  //Can also over ride the value directly in the constructor
  val dog = new Dog("dog")
  dog.eat
  println(dog.creatureType)
```

## Type substition

This is when the left hand side is the parent of the right hand side. A value can be an animal, instantiated as a dog as a dog extends Animal. See below:

```
val unknownAnimal : Animal = new Doggy("Labradour")
```

### Summary

OverRiding = Supplying a different implementation in derived classes
Overloading = supplying multiple methods with different signatures with the same names in the same class

Super, referencing a method in a parent class

### Preventing over rides

1. Use the keyword final - prevents derived classes from over riding methods - use final on meember
2. Add final on the class, prevents inheritence.
3. Seal the class - extend classes in this file, but prevents extension in other files. Often used to be exhaustive in the type hierarchy,
