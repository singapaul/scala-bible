### Call by name VS Call by Value



```
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "age": 25
}
```



```
{

  def calledByValue(x: Long): Unit = {
    println("by value " + x)
    println("by value " + x)
    }

  def calledByName(x: => Long): Unit = {
    println("by name " + x)
    println("by name " + x)
    }


  calledByValue(System.nanoTime())
  calledByName(System.nanoTime())

}
```

The funky arrow results in a call by name. It delays the evaluation of the function value Until it is uses. Extremely useful when handling streams.

```
{
    def infinite(): Int = 1 + infinite()
    def printFirst(x: Int, y: => Int) = println(x)
}
```

below will result in a stack overflow
 
```
{
 printFirst(infinite(),34)
}
```

The below will run, without crashing the stack

```
{
  printFirst(34, infinite())
}
```

The by name evaluation of y delays the evaluation of the y value
Until it is used by the programme. However it is never actually used, therefore the programme remains intact.

### Summary 

1) expresseion is passed literally
2) expression is evaluated everytime it is used.
